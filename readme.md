#NOTE:
While we are doing our best to keep the module back-end agnostic, we are using
Search API Solr powered views for our current project and as a result, that is 
all we are currently testing for.

Patches and pull requests are very welcome! :)


#D7 port of litecal
In porting to D7 we have attempted to maintain the 'lite' aspect of this module
but have also added minor features as we have needed them. Other features have
been reimplemented to take advantage of new features in Views 3 and use the 
existing Views API more effectively.
